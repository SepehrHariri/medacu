Due to its location, it is adhered to the front of our larynx from the outside.<\/p>\n<p>The hormones secreted by the thyroid gland regulate our rate of energy expenditure, that is, our metabolism. If the balance of these hormones is disturbed, results such as irritability or lethargy, excessive sweating or chills, weight gain or unjustified weight loss occur.<\/p>\n<p>Thyroid gland diseases are very common in the society and are called &#8220;goiter&#8221;. Some goiter patients are followed up with medication. The hormone levels of these patients should be checked at regular intervals. Most of the time, this group of people do not need thyroid gland (goiter) surgery. In another group of patients (especially those who are considered to be at high risk for cancer or who are found to have cancer), the thyroid gland must be removed surgically.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a large thyroid nodule, even if a piece is taken with a needle and the result is benign, we cannot be sure that there is no malignant disease in the area where the needle does not reach. The same is true for people with many small nodules.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the entire thyroid gland is removed, sometimes only one half. The most important point in these operations is the nerves that pass just below the thyroid gland and go to the vocal cords. The most common reason why patients avoid surgery is the risk of damage to these nerves. However, this risk is only 2 percent.<\/p>\n<p>Patients who do not have a thyroid gland, i.e. those who have been completely removed by surgery, take thyroid hormone in pills. People who take their medication regularly do not develop any deficiency due to the absence of the thyroid gland. Malignant diseases of the thyroid gland can be successfully treated today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thyroid Gland (Goiter) Surgery Thyroid gland (Goiter) Surgery is located in the lower half of our neck, front and center.
