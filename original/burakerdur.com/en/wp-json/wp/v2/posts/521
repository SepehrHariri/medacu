Especially in school-age children, prominent ear deformities cause serious social or psychological problems. For this reason, surgery is recommended for children with prominent ear deformities from the age of 5 as the development of ear cartilage is completed. While general anesthesia is usually used in children, local anesthesia or general anesthesia may be preferred in adults.<\/p>\n<h2>How is otoplasty performed?<\/h2>\n<p>The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia, but in adults it can also be performed under local anesthesia by numbing only the necessary areas. Through incisions made behind the auricle, the cartilages of the auricle are shaped and tissue is added or removed as needed. The surgery takes approximately 2-3 hours.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the healing process after otoplasty?<\/h2>\n<p>A bandage or splint is applied to the auricle after surgery. This helps to maintain the shape of the auricle. The bandage or splint is usually removed 1-2 weeks after surgery. Swelling and bruising may occur in the first few days after surgery. This usually resolves within a few weeks. It may take 6-12 months for the auricle to fully heal after surgery.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is otoplasty?
