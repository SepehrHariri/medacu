Advantages of the closed technique include the absence of an external scar and the reduced need for cartilage transplantation during the procedure. Advantages of the open technique include better visibility of the structures of the nose and easier learning for training surgeons. Most experts agree that the choice of technique \u2013 closed or open \u2013 is not of major importance. Experienced surgeons can achieve excellent results with both approaches.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Will I have an outside cast, inside nasal splints and after nose surgery? <\/b><\/h2>\n<p>At the end of the procedure I will typically place small strips of adhesive tape over your nose and place a cast on these strips. I will also put silicone nasal splints inside of th nose. These splints will have irfloww tunnel so you can breathe even with the splints. I will remove these splints and cast 1 week after surgery<\/p>\n<h2><b>Is the rhinoplasty operation painful?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Do not be afraid of pain. Of course, this depends on the patient&#8217;s pain perception level, however, during the first week&#8217;s check-up, 95% of patients say, &#8220;Doctor, thank you very much. I have little to no pain.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2><b>How long will I be off from work after rhinoplasty?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Generally speaking the swelling and bruising around your eyes and nose may last up to 7-10 days. The splints on and inside your nose will be removed 1 week after surgery. Most patients are 1-2 weeks off work after nose surgery<\/p>\n<h2><b>Can I wear glasses after nose surgery ?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>The nasal bones will not have healed completely until about 6 weeks after the procedure, and you could risk causing damage if you apply reading glasses, sunglasses or goggles to the bridge of the nose too early. I recommend to my patients can wear sunglasses or glasses after 3 months.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Can I do sports after rhinoplasty?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>You should refrain from exercise prior to removal of the cast and splints. After these have been removed, I will give you specific instructions when you may resume sports and at which intensity. Contact sports are typically avoided for at least one year. However fitness type walking or running can be done after 3-4 weeks.<\/p>\n<h2><b>What are possible risks and complications of nose surgery rhinoplasty?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Rhinoplasty is a technically difficult procedure. Expertise and experience is required to obtain favorable cosmetic results. The most frequent untoward effect of nose surgery is an unsatisfactory cosmetic (appearance) or functional (breathing) result. A secondary or touch up surgery may be required to obtain the intended result. Secondary procedures may be minor, some may be performed under local anaesthesia and \/ or as an outpatient procedure. The need for a secondary procedure does not signify poor quality of the initial surgery. Secondary or touch-up procedures are typically performed one year or later after the initial surgery. Other complications occur infrequently. These include: bleeding, infection, hypertrophic scar, discolouration.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Which season is more suitable for rhinoplasty?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>In the past, air conditioning and air conditioning methods were not so developed and people were afraid of being exposed to heat after surgery. As long as you are not exposed to direct sunlight and extreme heat, and of course if you can manage without wearing sunglasses, you can have surgery in any season.<\/p>\n<h2><b>When can I fly after rhinoplasty?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>I prefer to remove your nasal cast and nasal splints after 1 week. Even though there are no restrictions on flying just 1 day after rhinoplasty, you can return to your home country after 1 week.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Can I swim after rhinoplasty?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>The swimming pool and the sea contain many infectious agents. Therefore, you should wait one month after the operation before swimming to ensure the healing process is complete.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is the most appropriate age for a cosmetic rhinoplasty?
