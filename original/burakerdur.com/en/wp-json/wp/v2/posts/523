This surgery, which is performed to open the obstruction in the nose and sinuses, improve drainage and reduce the risk of infection, usually has a short recovery period and a low risk of complications.<\/p>\n<p>Purpose of the Surgery: This surgery aims to relieve the airway, treat infections and improve the natural drainage of the sinuses. It can correct various conditions such as polyps, sinus congestion or abnormalities in the facial bones.<\/p>\n<p>The surgery is performed using a thin tube called an endoscope, which is inserted into the nose and magnifies the sinus cavities. The endoscope gives the surgeon a clear view of the sinuses and allows him or her to precisely administer treatment with specialized surgical instruments. It is usually performed under general anesthesia and can take 1 to 2 hours, depending on the patient&#8217;s condition.<\/p>\n<p>Recovery Process: After the procedure, patients can usually return home the same day. Nasal congestion and mild facial pain may be experienced for the first few days, but this is usually manageable and resolves quickly. A few weeks may be needed for full recovery and mild nosebleeds or runny nose is normal during this process.<\/p>\n<p>Things to Watch Out For: Avoid picking your nose and avoid heavy exercise during the healing process. Remember to take the medication we recommend and keep your follow-up appointments. Adequate rest and proper nutrition are important to speed recovery.<\/p>\n<p>Risks As with any surgical procedure, endoscopic sinus surgery carries some risks, including infection, bleeding or, in rare cases, loss of smell. However, these risks are minimal and are further reduced when the procedure is performed by experienced surgeons.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Endoscopic Sinus Surgery Endoscopic sinus surgery is a minimally invasive procedure performed especially in patients with long-term sinus problems such as chronic sinusitis.
