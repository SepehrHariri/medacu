Bichectomy surgery is usually performed under local anesthesia, which means you will be awake but will not feel pain in the area. Through small incisions inside the mouth, the buccal fatty tissues are accessed and carefully removed. Because the incisions are made inside the mouth, there is no visible scarring. The healing process is usually simple. You may experience some swelling and discomfort, which will go away with medication. Most patients can return to normal activities within a few days.<\/p>\n<p>Postoperative Care: Eating soft foods and maintaining oral hygiene are important to prevent infection.
