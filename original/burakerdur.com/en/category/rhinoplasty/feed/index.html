										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Revision Rhinoplasty?</h2>
<p>Revision rhinoplasty is a surgical procedure I perform to correct or enhance the results of a previous nose surgery. It is often considered more complex than primary rhinoplasty due to the changes in anatomical structures from the initial operation.</p>
<h2>Why Might You Need a Revision?</h2>
<p>The reasons for considering a revision can be multifaceted. They often include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Functional Issues: </strong> Persistent or new breathing challenges that have arisen since your primary procedure.</li>
<li><strong>Aesthetic Concerns:</strong>  A desire to refine the shape or size of your nose if the outcome of the first surgery has not met your expectations or has resulted in aesthetic imbalances.</li>
<li><strong>Structural Changes: </strong> Addressing any asymmetry, collapse, or complications that have developed over time due to healing or surgical technique.</li>
</ul>
<p>While my aim is to achieve the best possible result for you, it is crucial to have realistic expectations. Revision rhinoplasty can offer significant improvements but is bound by the limitations of your individual anatomy and previous surgical changes.</p>
<h2>The Timing of Your Revision Surgery</h2>
<p>I typically advise waiting a minimum of 12 months after your initial surgery. This allows your nose to fully heal and settle into its new shape, giving us a clear and stable foundation for planning your revision.</p>
<h2>What to Expect During the Consultation ?</h2>
<p>During our consultation, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a thorough examination of your nose&#8217;s structure, both externally and internally.</li>
<li>Discuss your concerns and goals for the revision procedure.</li>
<li>Review photographs and, if needed, imaging studies to assess the underlying bone and cartilage.</li>
<li>Explain the surgical options, techniques, and the realistic outcomes you can anticipate.</li>
<li>Address any questions or concerns you may have.</li>
<li>The Revision Rhinoplasty Procedure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Revision rhinoplasty often involves sophisticated surgical techniques such as cartilage grafting, precise modification of nasal structures, and, when necessary, osteotomy. These techniques aim to restore both form and function to your nose. In revision rhinoplasty operation we commonly use some cartilage grafts and the main source of these cartilages will be rib cartilage.

<h2>Recovery and Aftercare</h2>
<p>The recovery process following revision rhinoplasty can be longer than after your first surgery. I will provide specific aftercare instructions to ensure optimal healing. You may experience swelling and bruising, which will gradually subside.</p>
<p>Recovery from revision rhinoplasty can be a lengthy process, and it&#8217;s essential to follow all postoperative instructions to support your healing. Your patience and adherence to these guidelines play a significant role in achieving the best possible outcome. Please remember that my team and I are here to support you every step of the way. Do not hesitate to reach out if you need assistance or have any concerns during your recovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>What is the most appropriate age for a cosmetic rhinoplasty?</b></h2>
<p>Studies suggest a minimal age of 17 years is preferred to perform rhinoplasty as the bony structures of the face near completion at this age and the shape of the bony skeleton of the face will not change much after this age.</p>
<h2><b>What are the differences between closed and open rhinoplasty?</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>Most experts agree that excellent results can be achieved with both the closed and the open technique. Advantages of the closed technique include the absence of an external scar and the reduced need for cartilage transplantation during the procedure. Advantages of the open technique include better visibility of the structures of the nose and easier learning for training surgeons. Most experts agree that the choice of technique – closed or open – is not of major importance. Experienced surgeons can achieve excellent results with both approaches.</p>
<h2><b>Will I have an outside cast, inside nasal splints and after nose surgery? </b></h2>
<p>At the end of the procedure I will typically place small strips of adhesive tape over your nose and place a cast on these strips. I will also put silicone nasal splints inside of th nose. These splints will have irfloww tunnel so you can breathe even with the splints. I will remove these splints and cast 1 week after surgery</p>
<h2><b>Is the rhinoplasty operation painful?</b></h2>
<p>Do not be afraid of pain. Of course, this depends on the patient&#8217;s pain perception level, however, during the first week&#8217;s check-up, 95% of patients say, &#8220;Doctor, thank you very much. I have little to no pain.&#8221;</p>
<h2><b>How long will I be off from work after rhinoplasty?</b></h2>
<p>Generally speaking the swelling and bruising around your eyes and nose may last up to 7-10 days. The splints on and inside your nose will be removed 1 week after surgery. Most patients are 1-2 weeks off work after nose surgery</p>
<h2><b>Can I wear glasses after nose surgery ?</b></h2>
<p>The nasal bones will not have healed completely until about 6 weeks after the procedure, and you could risk causing damage if you apply reading glasses, sunglasses or goggles to the bridge of the nose too early. I recommend to my patients can wear sunglasses or glasses after 3 months.</p>
<h2><b>Can I do sports after rhinoplasty?</b></h2>
<p>You should refrain from exercise prior to removal of the cast and splints. After these have been removed, I will give you specific instructions when you may resume sports and at which intensity. Contact sports are typically avoided for at least one year. However fitness type walking or running can be done after 3-4 weeks.</p>
<h2><b>What are possible risks and complications of nose surgery rhinoplasty?</b></h2>
<p>Rhinoplasty is a technically difficult procedure. Expertise and experience is required to obtain favorable cosmetic results. The most frequent untoward effect of nose surgery is an unsatisfactory cosmetic (appearance) or functional (breathing) result. A secondary or touch up surgery may be required to obtain the intended result. Secondary procedures may be minor, some may be performed under local anaesthesia and / or as an outpatient procedure. The need for a secondary procedure does not signify poor quality of the initial surgery. Secondary or touch-up procedures are typically performed one year or later after the initial surgery. Other complications occur infrequently. These include: bleeding, infection, hypertrophic scar, discolouration.</p>
<h2><b>Which season is more suitable for rhinoplasty?</b></h2>
<p>In the past, air conditioning and air conditioning methods were not so developed and people were afraid of being exposed to heat after surgery. As long as you are not exposed to direct sunlight and extreme heat, and of course if you can manage without wearing sunglasses, you can have surgery in any season.</p>
<h2><b>When can I fly after rhinoplasty?</b></h2>
<p>I prefer to remove your nasal cast and nasal splints after 1 week. Even though there are no restrictions on flying just 1 day after rhinoplasty, you can return to your home country after 1 week.</p>
<h2><b>Can I swim after rhinoplasty?</b></h2>
<p>The swimming pool and the sea contain many infectious agents. Therefore, you should wait one month after the operation before swimming to ensure the healing process is complete.</p>
