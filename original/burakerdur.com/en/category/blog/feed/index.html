										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>STEP 1: FIRST CONTACT </b></h2>
<p>After your initial contact with our clinic via social media or WhatsApp, we will schedule a video call to provide you with more details about the surgical process. During this call, you&#8217;ll have the opportunity to speak with Dr. Burak Erdur, ask any questions, and express your expectations regarding the surgery. Following that, we will set a suitable surgery date for you.</p>
<h2><b>STEP 2: ARRIVAL TO THE CLINIC </b></h2>
<p>Once a surgery date is decided upon, we will request that you arrive at our clinic in Istanbul one day prior to your surgery. This visit will be for you to meet Dr. Burak Erdur and to undergo preoperative preparations. As part of the preoperative process, you will have some blood tests and undergo an anesthesia evaluation. Dr. Burak will also conduct a detailed nasal examination and take photographs for a Photoshop simulation in our office. This simulation will aid in clarifying your desires and managing expectations.</p>
<h2><b>STEP 3: SURGERY </b></h2>
<p>Now, you are ready for surgery. Please arrive at the hospital early in the morning. Dr. Burak Erdur will perform your rhinoplasty, which typically takes 3-4 hours. Post-surgery, he will visit your room for an initial check and to provide updates to any accompanying person. You will spend one night in the hospital post-surgery. Rest assured, our experienced nursing team will administer all your post-surgical medications, including antibiotics and painkillers. You are in good hands. The day following the surgery, Dr. Erdur will conduct a follow-up examination, discussing all details about your medications, any restrictions, and so on. After this, you will be discharged from the hospital.</p>
<h2><b>STEP 4: CONTROL EXAMINATION </b></h2>
<p>During the first week post-surgery, you will return to the clinic for a control examination, during which your nasal cast and splints will be removed. After this, you&#8217;re free to return to your home country. We will also conduct online follow-up examinations. Remember, you can contact us anytime should you need assistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Why Choose Rib Cartilage?</h2>
<p>As we explore the options for your revision rhinoplasty, one of the key considerations is the source of graft material that will be used to support or augment the nasal structure. In some cases, especially when there is a lack of sufficient cartilage within the nose itself due to previous surgeries, we may need to use cartilage from another area of your body. Rib cartilage has proven to be an excellent source for this purpose.</p>
<p>Rib cartilage is favored for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volume and Strength:</strong> It provides a substantial amount of cartilage, which is often necessary for extensive reconstructive efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> It can be carved and shaped to the precise dimensions needed to rebuild the nasal framework.</li>
<li><strong>Biocompatibility:</strong> As it is your own tissue, the risk of rejection is minimized, and it integrates well with your nasal tissues.</li>
<li><strong>Durability:</strong> Rib cartilage is robust and maintains its shape over time, ensuring the longevity of the results.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Harvesting Rib Cartilage</h2>
<p>The process of obtaining rib cartilage involves a separate procedure, which I perform under general anesthesia. Here&#8217;s what you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incision Site:</strong> I typically make a small incision over the chest wall to access the rib cartilage. This is done discreetly, often below the breast line or along the natural creases to minimize visible scarring.</li>
<li><strong>Amount Taken:</strong> Only a small segment of the cartilage is removed, preserving the integrity of the rib cage.</li>
<li><strong>Closure:</strong> The incision is closed with meticulous care to promote optimal healing and reduce scarring.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Benefits Using rib cartilage in revision rhinoplasty offers distinct benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adequate Material:</strong> It ensures that we have enough high-quality cartilage to achieve the structural changes needed.</li>
<li><strong>Long-Term Stability:</strong> Provides a stable and long-lasting framework for the nose.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Warping:</strong> Rib cartilage tends to resist warping better than other types of cartilage, maintaining the desired shape of the nose.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Integration:</strong> Your body naturally integrates the rib cartilage, making it a part of your nasal structure over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Potential Risks and Complications</h2>
<p>While the use of rib cartilage is generally safe, there are potential risks which I ensure to discuss with my patients:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chest Wall Sensitivity:</strong> Some patients may experience discomfort or a sensation of tightness where the cartilage was removed.</li>
<li><strong>Scarring:</strong> There will be a scar at the site of the incision, which we endeavor to keep as inconspicuous as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Pneumothorax:</strong> A very rare but serious complication where the lung is accidentally punctured, leading to a collapsed lung. This is a risk inherent in any surgery where the chest wall is involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing to use rib cartilage in your revision rhinoplasty is an important decision. My role is to provide you with all the information necessary to make an informed choice that aligns with your goals for surgery. We will discuss all aspects of the procedure, the inherent complexities, and how this approach fits within the broader strategy to achieve your desired outcome.</p>
<p>Please bring any questions you have to our next consultation. I am here to guide you through this process with the utmost care and expertise. With best regards,</p>
