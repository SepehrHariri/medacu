										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is otoplasty?</h2>
<p>Otoplasty is an operation to change the shape and/or size of the auricle. Otoplasty can be performed due to aesthetic concerns about the shape, size or position of the auricle or functional problems such as the auricle protruding more forward than normal.</p>
<p>Prominent Ear Correction (Otoplasty)</p>
<p>Operation time 2 Hours</p>
<p>Hospitalization : 1 night</p>
<p>Type of Anesthesia: General or Local Anesthesia</p>
<p>Recovery Time: 7-10 Days</p>
<h2>In which cases is otoplasty performed?</h2>
<p>Aesthetic concerns due to the shape or size of the auricle<br />
Social or psychological problems due to the auricle protruding forward more than normal<br />
Congenital or post-traumatic deformities of the auricle</p>
<h2>From what age can it be performed?</h2>
<p>Otoplasty can be performed from the age of 5, when the development of the auricle is complete. Especially in school-age children, prominent ear deformities cause serious social or psychological problems. For this reason, surgery is recommended for children with prominent ear deformities from the age of 5 as the development of ear cartilage is completed. While general anesthesia is usually used in children, local anesthesia or general anesthesia may be preferred in adults.</p>
<h2>How is otoplasty performed?</h2>
<p>The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia, but in adults it can also be performed under local anesthesia by numbing only the necessary areas. Through incisions made behind the auricle, the cartilages of the auricle are shaped and tissue is added or removed as needed. The surgery takes approximately 2-3 hours.</p>
<h2>What is the healing process after otoplasty?</h2>
<p>A bandage or splint is applied to the auricle after surgery. This helps to maintain the shape of the auricle. The bandage or splint is usually removed 1-2 weeks after surgery. Swelling and bruising may occur in the first few days after surgery. This usually resolves within a few weeks. It may take 6-12 months for the auricle to fully heal after surgery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bichectomy</h2>
<p>Bichectomy is a cosmetic procedure that aims to create a more defined contour on the face. This is done by removing the buccal fat tissues, which are natural fat deposits in the cheeks.</p>
<p>Operation time 1 hour</p>
<p>Hospitalization : Usually day hospitalization</p>
<p>Type of Anesthesia Local Anesthesia</p>
<p>Recovery Time: 7-10 Days</p>
<p>This procedure is usually suitable for individuals whose cheeks feel too full or &#8220;round&#8221; despite their healthy body weight. Ideal candidates are those seeking more defined cheekbones and a sculpted facial appearance.</p>
<p>The surgical procedure is usually completed in as little as one hour. Bichectomy surgery is usually performed under local anesthesia, which means you will be awake but will not feel pain in the area. Through small incisions inside the mouth, the buccal fatty tissues are accessed and carefully removed. Because the incisions are made inside the mouth, there is no visible scarring. The healing process is usually simple. You may experience some swelling and discomfort, which will go away with medication. Most patients can return to normal activities within a few days.</p>
<p>Postoperative Care: Eating soft foods and maintaining oral hygiene are important to prevent infection. Cold compresses can help reduce swelling.</p>
<p>The thinning effect on the cheeks is not immediately noticeable due to swelling. It may take a few weeks to see results. The removed fat pads cannot grow back, so the results are permanent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Eyelid Aesthetics (Blepharoplasty)</h2>
<p>Eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) is a surgical procedure to change the shape and/or size of the eyelids. It can be performed on the upper and/or lower eyelids.</p>
<p>Excess skin on the upper eyelid can cause the eyelid to sag and the eyes to look tired. Excess fat in the lower eyelid can create bags under the eyes and make the eyes look tired or old. Sagging lower eyelids can cause the white part of the eyelid to show too much. Eyelid (blepharoplasty) can be performed in patients with such problems.</p>
<h2>Operation time 1-2 hours</h2>
<p><strong>Hospitalization :</strong> Usually day hospitalization</p>
<p><strong>Type of Anesthesia:</strong> General or Local Anesthesia</p>
<p><strong>Recovery Time:</strong> 7-10 Days</p>
<h2>What are the types of blepharoplasty?</h2>
<p>There are two types of eyelid aesthetics:</p>
<p><strong>Upper eyelid surgery:</strong> This procedure removes excess skin and fat from the upper eyelids.</p>
<p><strong>Lower eyelid surgery:</strong> This procedure removes bags under the eyes and excess fat from the lower eyelids.</p>
<h2>What is the recovery from blepharoplasty?</h2>
<p>Recovery from blepharoplasty is usually quick and easy. Most people can return to work and normal activities within a few days after surgery. However, it is important to take care of the eyelids during the healing process and it may be necessary to apply ice packs to the eyelids to reduce swelling, use eye drops to keep the eyes moist, avoid heavy activity and wear sunglasses when outdoors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Salivary Gland Surgery</h2>
<p>Salivary Gland Surgeries We have a total of 3 pairs of large salivary glands, one in front of our ear on the right and left (parotid gland), one under our chin on the right and left (submandibular gland) and one under our tongue in the mouth on the right and left (sublingual gland). Apart from these, there are many small salivary glands embedded in the skin lining the inside of the mouth.</p>
<p>Salivary gland surgery:</p>
<p>&#8211; mass-related diseases</p>
<p>&#8211; salivary gland stones and</p>
<p>&#8211; may be needed for chronic recurrent salivary gland infections.</p>
<p>When we find an uncontrolled growth, i.e. a mass, in any salivary gland, large or small, we usually take a biopsy. The biopsy result tells us whether this mass is benign or malignant and according to this result, we decide on the scope of salivary gland surgeries we will perform later.</p>
<p>As my patients often wonder, there is a possibility that benign salivary gland tumors may worsen later. This is not true for benign tumors of every organ. Therefore, a salivary gland tumor should be operated on as soon as it is detected.</p>
<p>The most important feature of these operations is that they are performed around the nerves that create the movements and facial expressions on our face. Many people do not want to have surgery even though it is necessary because they are afraid of the risk of nerve damage. However, the risk of early surgeries is quite low. In operations performed for tumors that grow over time, the risks grow proportionally. With the development of technology, the facilities used during the operation have also improved, and the possibility of damage to the nerves we mentioned has decreased considerably compared to the past.</p>
<p>In operations performed for reasons other than tumors, such as salivary gland stones or chronic infections, the salivary gland with the disease is removed as a whole. In mass-tumor surgeries, we often prefer to also remove the lymph nodes, which are at high risk of spreading. Endoscopic interventions to remove only the stone have a high risk of recurrence and a high rate of reoperation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Thyroid Gland (Goiter) Surgery</h2>
<p>Thyroid gland (Goiter) Surgery is located in the lower half of our neck, front and center. Due to its location, it is adhered to the front of our larynx from the outside.</p>
<p>The hormones secreted by the thyroid gland regulate our rate of energy expenditure, that is, our metabolism. If the balance of these hormones is disturbed, results such as irritability or lethargy, excessive sweating or chills, weight gain or unjustified weight loss occur.</p>
<p>Thyroid gland diseases are very common in the society and are called &#8220;goiter&#8221;. Some goiter patients are followed up with medication. The hormone levels of these patients should be checked at regular intervals. Most of the time, this group of people do not need thyroid gland (goiter) surgery. In another group of patients (especially those who are considered to be at high risk for cancer or who are found to have cancer), the thyroid gland must be removed surgically.</p>
<p>If you have a large thyroid nodule, even if a piece is taken with a needle and the result is benign, we cannot be sure that there is no malignant disease in the area where the needle does not reach. The same is true for people with many small nodules.</p>
<p>Sometimes the entire thyroid gland is removed, sometimes only one half. The most important point in these operations is the nerves that pass just below the thyroid gland and go to the vocal cords. The most common reason why patients avoid surgery is the risk of damage to these nerves. However, this risk is only 2 percent.</p>
<p>Patients who do not have a thyroid gland, i.e. those who have been completely removed by surgery, take thyroid hormone in pills. People who take their medication regularly do not develop any deficiency due to the absence of the thyroid gland. Malignant diseases of the thyroid gland can be successfully treated today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Endoscopic Sinus Surgery</h2>
<p>Endoscopic sinus surgery is a minimally invasive procedure performed especially in patients with long-term sinus problems such as chronic sinusitis. This surgery, which is performed to open the obstruction in the nose and sinuses, improve drainage and reduce the risk of infection, usually has a short recovery period and a low risk of complications.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Surgery: This surgery aims to relieve the airway, treat infections and improve the natural drainage of the sinuses. It can correct various conditions such as polyps, sinus congestion or abnormalities in the facial bones.</p>
<p>The surgery is performed using a thin tube called an endoscope, which is inserted into the nose and magnifies the sinus cavities. The endoscope gives the surgeon a clear view of the sinuses and allows him or her to precisely administer treatment with specialized surgical instruments. It is usually performed under general anesthesia and can take 1 to 2 hours, depending on the patient&#8217;s condition.</p>
<p>Recovery Process: After the procedure, patients can usually return home the same day. Nasal congestion and mild facial pain may be experienced for the first few days, but this is usually manageable and resolves quickly. A few weeks may be needed for full recovery and mild nosebleeds or runny nose is normal during this process.</p>
<p>Things to Watch Out For: Avoid picking your nose and avoid heavy exercise during the healing process. Remember to take the medication we recommend and keep your follow-up appointments. Adequate rest and proper nutrition are important to speed recovery.</p>
<p>Risks As with any surgical procedure, endoscopic sinus surgery carries some risks, including infection, bleeding or, in rare cases, loss of smell. However, these risks are minimal and are further reduced when the procedure is performed by experienced surgeons.</p>
